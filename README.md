I'm currently working as a research associate in the biotech industry and I'm new to coding. I'd like to learn more about trends in the bioinformatics field and possible applications of machine learning in biochemical research. Starting Fall 2021, I'll be working towards a degree in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. In my spare time, I like making digital art :art:
